# 🎓 Student Grade Management System

This is a real-world backend project built to automate student grade management using **Python**, **Excel**, **SQL**, and **data visualization tools**. I developed this project as part of my graduate coursework to simulate how schools or universities might manage student performance records.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Read student scores from Excel
- ✅ Calculate average and assign letter grades (A–F)
- ✅ Store results in a **SQLite** database
- ✅ Generate a **professional-grade bar chart** of grade distribution
- ✅ Provide an **interactive CLI tool** to search/filter students
- ✅ Export final results to both **Excel** and **PDF**
- ✅ Designed for **real-world usability and resume-building**

## 💡 Project Purpose

This project was created to:
- Practice using real-world data tools (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Matplotlib)
- Learn how to automate reporting and querying student records
- Build a reusable and extensible backend system for schools
- Demonstrate full-cycle data handling from input to visualization and export
