# 🎓 Student Grade Management System

This is a real-world backend project built to automate student grade management using **Python**, **Excel**, **SQL**, and **data visualization tools**. I developed this project as part of my graduate coursework to simulate how schools or universities might manage student performance records.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Read student scores from Excel
- ✅ Calculate average and assign letter grades (A–F)
- ✅ Store results in a **SQLite** database
- ✅ Generate a **professional-grade bar chart** of grade distribution
- ✅ Provide an **interactive CLI tool** to search/filter students
- ✅ Export final results to both **Excel** and **PDF**
- ✅ Designed for **real-world usability and resume-building**
